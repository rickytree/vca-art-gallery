"I approached the familiar landscape of rice paddies that we usually pass by without much thought, with a fresh perspective. Within it, the sound of rice swaying against the wind, the subtle movements of insects, and the leaps of frogs unfold not as mere background noises, but as individual entities with their own presence.<br /><br />

I wanted to observe and interpret the natural environment we are accustomed to seeing from a completely new perspective. For example, by recreating the world as seen from an insect's point of view, I focus on the minute details that human vision cannot capture and the diversity of nature that is usually unrecognizable.<br /><br />

I create art using TouchDesigner. My creative process is deeply intertwined with everyday sensations, dreams, and memories. These elements take on a unique form within me, and based on them, I constantly experiment and express myself.<br /><br />

This recent piece was born from the same flow. One day, a specific memory surfaced in my consciousness. I explored the relationship between that memory and myself, delving into the hidden meanings and emotions within it, and attempted to elevate it into my artwork.<br /><br />

While my art originates from personal experiences and feelings, I aim to evoke empathy and fresh sensations in those who view it." <br /><br />

**Artist Bio:**<br /><br />
Initially, I was involved in design work using Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator. Through a serendipitous encounter, I had the opportunity to see the artworks of John Maeda, and it sparked my interest in creating art through a completely different process than what I had known, involving programming. I began by creating pieces using Processing, but now I utilize TouchDesigner for my artwork production.<br /><br />
