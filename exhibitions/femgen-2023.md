VERTICAL is pleased to present **_FEMGEN_**, in partnership with _Right Click Save_ featuring six leading artists working with generative systems. Following its first edition in Miami last December, this week **_FEMGEN_** comes to Marfa as part of **_Art Blocks Marfa Weekend 2023_**.<br /><br />

**_FEMGEN’s_** plural identity as a dynamic movement, an exhibition series and an ongoing conversation is designed to make space for female and non-binary artists working with generative systems. Born in the pursuit of a new art world that fosters diversity, openness, and greater access, **_FEMGEN_** is dedicated to cultivating a more inclusive ecosystem for artists.<br /><br />

**_FEMGEN_** shows the work of six artists: Anna Beller, Emi Kusano, Emily Edelman, Helena Sarin, Kaoru Tanaka and Lauren Lee Mccarthy. Each artist works with generative systems in unique ways, from code to photography to text to movement to AI. **_FEMGEN_** seeks to celebrate and broaden the concept of generative art, moving beyond its traditional foundation in code-based work to encompass and expand its identity into practices that generate artistic forms and creations through diverse means.<br /><br />
