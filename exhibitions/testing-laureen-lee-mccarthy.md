"In an increasingly generated world, it can be difficult to find the edges of our collectively simulated dream. This generative series of tests invites you to question your own waking state. Simultaneously authoritative and absurd, you may find the instructions resemble those you constantly receive from technology directing you how to behave.<br /><br />

With all of my work, I aim to create something that moves beyond the screen and into the physical world. In Testing, rather than passively looking, the people in the space become part of the piece as they are invited to actively engage and perform the instructions."<br /><br />
