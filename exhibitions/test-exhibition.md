<h2>RELEASE SCHEDULE</h2>

<p>
VerticalCrypto Art presents COMPANIONS OF CODE in partnership with The NFT Gallery. This group exhibition showcases eleven international generative artists and seeks to examine the relationship between the artist and the code and how the two are inseparable.
<br><br>
On the occasion of COMPANIONS OF CODE, the artists will be presenting new series of long form generative art collections resulting from their collaboration between the code and their human input. This exhibition seeks to extend this notion of companionship between the code and the artist and highlight how the two walk hand in hand in the creation of code-generated artworks.
