Red Shapes is a geometric study between shape and space. <br /><br />

The series is inspired by a random collection of studio paper leftovers - used as a background for spray-paint works with an interesting spatial effect. <br />
For the digital series I chose a very minimalist set of geometric elements, layered and arranged them in different ways finding new surprising shapes and rhythm. <br /><br />

The appearance of the outputs is intentionally very digital and raw, on one hand reminding of harmonic Bauhaus design, vertical architecture or ground plans - but on the other hand it has an aggressive expression, asking questions between materiality and immateriality, physical and digital space, or even challenging the logic of digital: everywhere but nowhere.<br /><br />

**Artist Bio:**<br /><br />
Anna Beller is an experimental painter and architect from Germany. In her process-oriented analog artworks she experiments with natural colour flow versus human intervention: a game between giving up control versus mechanical determination producing unexpected results. In her digital graphical and generative artworks she experiments with strong logical concepts, following rules but playing with them, leading to surprising results.
