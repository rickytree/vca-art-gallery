"Across the broad acres of time flashes this one acute moment that is Friday September 22nd, 2023 at the FEMGEN show at Glitch Gallery in Marfa, Texas. Using straightforward, logistical phrases, Cosmico is meant to focus viewers on this exact point between history and future — with profound awareness.<br /><br />

Using a system of text developed from the artist’s own handwriting, a fervent scrawl across 24 outputs grasps for something intangible.<br /><br />

While the majority of the 24 images are grayscale, three stand out with warm, reddish hues inspired by the colors of Marfa: moments of desert light in a vast landscape. Cosmico juxtaposes the intimate and immediate nature of handwriting with the sensation of an ongoing timeline and a whole wide world. Each is a wisp of experience, a perception that dissipates like campfire smoke."
