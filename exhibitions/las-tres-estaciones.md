"The tall, graceful, long-leav’d corn, the sturdy stalks, and the rustling in the breeze… Truly, in color, outline, material and spiritual suggestiveness, where any more inclosing theme for idealist, poet, literary artist?"<br />
 - Walt Whitman<br /><br />

The work is the celebration of the New World culture - arts, crafts, music and food, through blending of the tangible/earthy and the spiritual - reimagining Aztec visual symbols - like those found in pottery, blankets, and mural paintings of the Indigenous cultures of Latin America - the pre-Columbian deities of the earth, plants and sun. I use AI as the mechanism for careful reinterpreting and reimagining - that’s why I lovingly call my models AIztec.<br /><br />

it’s about the place somewhere in Americas, where the corn has its personal goddess, Chicomecōātl, and where are just three seasons - spring for digging the dirt and planting seedlings, summer for growing and blooming and fruiting, al that hard work culminating in the gloriously hot Indian summers of abundance and harvest. And oh no, no winter - hey Vivaldi, terribly sorry - it’s brave New World out here !<br /><br />

Every day starts early with the sound of quenta and ends with fiesta - fire roasted corn and poblano through the sunset!
Wish we were there.<br /><br />

The work is a collab with Toronto based composer Mikhail Galkin who created the soundtrack based on the visual part of the animation.<br /><br />

**Artist Bio:** <br /><br />
The psychologist Daniel E. Berger claims the most important aspects of art are “novelty, surprise, complexity, ambiguity and eccentricity”, Sarin’s GAN artworks have all five in abundance.” - wrote Unit London in 2019.<br /><br />

Visual artist, software engineer and maker (she calls herself an engineering artist) Helena Sarin has always worked with cutting- edge technologies for tech companies. At the same time, she has done commission work in watercolor and pastel, as well as in the applied arts like fashion, food, and drink styling and photography. But art and software ran as parallel tracks in her life, all her art being analog, until she discovered GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks). Since then generative models became her primary medium - creating at the intersection of technology and art elevated her artistic voice. She is a frequent speaker at ML/AI conferences, in the last two years delivering invited talks at MIT, Eyeo Festival, Library of Congress, Capitol One, Adobe Research, CMU, TEDx Konstanz. Her artwork was exhibited at AI Art exhibitions in Zurich, Dubai, Oxford, Shanghai, Miami, Zaragoza, Lutz, and was featured in a number of publications including twice in the magazine “Art In America.”, as well as upcoming books on NFT Art by Rizzoli and Taschen. She published an artist book “The Book of GANesis” that was immediately sold out; “GANcommedia Erudita” and “Leaves of Manifold” have been exhibited in the Nvidia AI Art Gallery, and just recently “The Book of #veGAN”.<br /><br />

In the last couple years her main focus has been on generative pottery, what she calls #potteryGAN.<br /><br />

She has been engaged with crypto art since early 2020 and since then became the one of the top artists on Foundation and SuperRare marketplaces. Helena resides in the NJ suburbs with a rescue dog named Cumin, three GPUs and husband.
